## Basic function

Different pressures are passed to either side of a membrane where the difference of pressures are converted into a differential force. A loadcell (frequently used in electronic scales) converts this differential force into electrical signal (differential voltage). By means of an amplification and ADC circuitry this differential voltage is converted to a digital signal. 

## Disclaimer

So far there hasn't been done further testing neither with the pressure sensor nor the flow sensor. Thorough checking for leaks and accurate calibration has to be performed before you can expect reliable measurements with the described DIY setup. Especially long-term stability and EMC-safety have to be considered. The design is provided "as is" without taking over responsibilty for any harm or loss caused by using it.
